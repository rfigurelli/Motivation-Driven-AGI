# Motivation-Driven AGI: Chain of Motivation Framework

This repository introduces the original white paper proposing a new conceptual framework for the evolution of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) based on **motivation-driven learning**.

Unlike traditional architectures that focus solely on reasoning or curiosity, **Chain of Motivation** enables AI systems to **expand knowledge across domains** by identifying motivational bridges between fields.  
Motivation becomes the catalyst for exploration, adaptation, and interdisciplinary understanding.

The framework complements the previously proposed **Hierarchical Tokens for Structured General Intelligence** (structure) and **Chain of Curiosity for Curiosity-Driven AGI** (exploration),  
focusing specifically on **the emotional and cognitive forces that drive cross-domain learning and knowledge expansion**.
